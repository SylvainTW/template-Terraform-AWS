# Terraform Modules

## Overview

This directory houses various Terraform modules, each designed to manage specific AWS resources or configurations. Modules allow for modular and reusable infrastructure as code (IaC) components.

## Usage

To use a module in your Terraform configuration:

1. Module Structure: Each module includes a README.md, main.tf, outputs.tf, and variable.tf.
2. Variables: Review the variables defined in variable.tf to understand the inputs required by the module.
3. Main Configuration: Incorporate the module in your main Terraform configuration (main.tf) by referencing its variables and outputs.

## Explanation of Current Module Usage

Currently, we primarily use pre-existing modules created by the [AWS community](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/terraform-aws-modules). These modules are copied into our local project directory and used directly. This approach allows us to leverage the expertise and best practices encapsulated in these community modules while **quickly deploying our infrastructure**.

## Future Plans for Module Management

In the future, we plan to create dedicated repositories for our modules and version them appropriately. This will provide several benefits:

1. Version Control: By versioning our modules, we can ensure stability and consistency across deployments. Specific versions can be locked, preventing unexpected changes from affecting our infrastructure.
2. Collaboration: Storing modules in separate repositories will facilitate collaboration among team members. Changes to the modules can be reviewed and managed independently from the main project.
3. Reusability: Well-defined and versioned modules can be reused across different projects, enhancing efficiency and maintainability.
